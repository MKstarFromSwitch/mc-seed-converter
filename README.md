<strong>Minecraft seed converter</strong>

There are two different editions of the minecraft video game, the minecraft java edition and the minecraft bedrock edition. This particularity includes a fairly significant problem, world saves cannot be converted from one edition to the other: however, when you create a save, a generation seed is associated with it and is used to generate a minecraft world.

This tool allows you to convert minecraft world generation seeds from the bedrock edition to the java edition, and vice versa.
When using the tool, note that: 


-All Minecraft Bedrock generation seeds can be converted to Java seeds.<br>
-You will not be able to convert all Minecraft Java edition seeds to Minecraft Bedrock seeds.<br>
-There will be some differences in the world generated.<br>
-The appearance points will probably be different.<br>
-Structures such as desert temples, jungle temples, mine shafts and fortresses will not be in the same place.<br>
-The biomes and map will be close to the seed of the original world.<br>
